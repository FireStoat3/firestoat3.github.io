                    Hi, I'm Matteo (<abbr title="Also Known As">AKA</abbr> FireStoat3), just a simple guy who really enjoys learning about programming! I'm currently studying for getting a master's degree in Computer Science.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    What did you develop?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    By studying for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I had the possibility to co-develop various products. One of them is the website UNI COOKED, whose repository is available on <a href="https://github.com/Uni-cooked/uni-cooked" hreflang="it">GitHub</a> and placed fourth in the <a href="https://web.math.unipd.it/CAA/" hreflang="it" lang="it">Accattivante Accessibile</a> contest. <br/>
                    I was also part of the <a href="https://alimitedgroup.github.io/">ALimitedGroup</a> team, whose members developed a <strong>distributed warehouse system</strong> concept for the Software Engineering course: check it out on <a href="https://github.com/alimitedgroup" hreflang="it">GitHub</a>! <br/>
                    Please note that my first language is Italian so the majority of the links contained in this page are to webpages in <strong>Italian</strong>.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Did you also develop some personal projects?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Yes, check them out on the <a href="./pages/projects.html">dedicated webpage</a>!
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Have you done any internships?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Yes! In order to get my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, a small 320-hours internship was mandatory. I did mine at <a href="https://www.riskapp.it/" hreflang="en">RiskApp Srl</a>, researching how to improve their remote videoinspection tool. Unfortunately, I can't share any code of that due to copyright reasons.
